        <h1>Welcome to The Haunted Inn!</h1>
        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>In 2017 Jane and John Doe retired and bought an old victorian house in Ulster County, New York; with the plan to refirbish it and turn it into a bed and breakfast. After purchasing it they discovered something horrifying: it was haunted! However, they still continued with their plan. Now it's a hopping place full of spirits and mortals alike!</p>
